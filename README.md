# forbetterbirth

A simple, responsive web application designed for easy tracking of the outcomes of women and their babies during and after pregnancy. 

Created for Ariadne Labs's [Better Birth Program](http://www.ariadnelabs.org/programs/betterbirth/) @ [IDHack 2015](http://idhack.developersfordevelopment.org/) in a very busy 14 hours.

Built with Django and Bootstrap.

## To Do

- Clean up files! Seriously.
- Design icon-based interface for low literacy users
- Maybe move away from Bootstrap
- Switch to a better database relationship for women and their babies
- Fully implement Visits
- Fully implement add/edit/delete functionality for women and babies
- Make statistics easier to export
- Create graphs from statistics collected
